	<h1>About Sexy eGirl</h1>
	<p class="lead">Sexy eGirl started off way back in early 2017 as a joke bot created for me and a few friends.
	The name and avatar image were part of the joke, and it only had a few minor response commands. I added a few features here
	and there, and before I knew it people were asking me for an invite so they could add it to their servers. This gave me inspiration
	to work and work on it. It grew and became ever more complex. My friends and people in other Discord servers gave me ideas and suggestions,
	which was a major help. Around July, I went off on a week long vacation. People were begging me to bring it back online, and this really showed
	me how much people cared about it. It wasn't a joke anymore, it was something serious that I then put hours of work into. More and more people
	added it to their servers, to the point where I decided to make it public. I applied it to the <a href="https://bots.discord.pw">
	Bots.Discord.pw</a> website, and on October 30, 2017, it was verified onto the website. If you want to check it out, just go <a href="https://bots.discord.pw/bots/343569690972389398">here.</a>
	I would like to thank all of my friends and the people I met in it's early stages who gave me the confidence to bring it up to what it is today!</p>
